Note that I am running the server in the free tier. A downside of the free tier is that it shuts down the server if it is inactive. If the server recieves a request while it's inactive, it will take about 1 minute to reactivate it. So if you visit the site for the first time, it may be stuck in the loading state for about a minute because the server is being reactivated. After the server is up and running, all subsequent requests will work as normal
